# SportShop
SportShop is a sports accessories store that we created for the Database classes.  
The whole part of the database was developed in SQL Server, while the interface was developed in C#.
  
Each folder contains a README.md file with instructions on how to use your files, however below is a brief summary of each folder
* sql: in this folder are all the SQL files for creating SportShop database.
* interface-c#: in this folder are all of the C# codes that implement the SportShop interface.
* data-generator: in this folder are the codes used to generate inserts and updates.
